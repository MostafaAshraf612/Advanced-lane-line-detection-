Sure! Here's a full, well-structured README.md for your lane detection project:

# Advanced Lane Detection and Vehicle Positioning

## Description
This project implements a complete lane detection pipeline using Python and OpenCV. It processes images and video from a front-facing vehicle camera to detect lane lines, fit polynomial curves, calculate lane curvature, and determine vehicle position relative to the lane center.

## Features
- Image and video processing for lane detection  
- Color and gradient thresholding for robust line detection  
- Polynomial fitting to extract lane curvature  
- Vehicle offset calculation from lane center  
- Visualization of detected lanes on images and videos  

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- MoviePy  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>


Navigate to the project directory:

cd <project-directory>


Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Process Images
from lane_detection import process_image

output = process_image("test_image.jpg")
output.show()

Process Video
from lane_detection import process_video

process_video("input_video.mp4", "output_video.mp4")
