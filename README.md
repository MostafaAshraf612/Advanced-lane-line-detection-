# Advanced-lane-line-detection-
Project Overview

This project is focused on developing a robust lane detection system using computer vision techniques in Python. The goal is to accurately identify lane lines on the road from images or video captured by a front-facing camera mounted on a vehicle. Beyond simple lane detection, the system calculates the curvature of each lane and determines the vehicle’s position relative to the lane center. This information is critical for applications in autonomous driving, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and robotics research.

The project integrates several key stages in the lane detection pipeline, combining classical image processing with polynomial curve fitting:

Image Preprocessing

Converts images to grayscale or color spaces that enhance lane visibility (e.g., HLS).

Applies noise reduction using Gaussian blur.

Uses gradient and color thresholding to create a binary image highlighting lane pixels.

Perspective Transform

Transforms the camera view into a bird’s-eye view to make lane lines appear parallel.

Simplifies lane detection and polynomial fitting by removing perspective distortion.

Lane Pixel Identification

Utilizes sliding window or convolution methods to detect lane line pixels in the binary image.

Keeps track of left and right lane pixels separately for accurate curve fitting.

Polynomial Fitting

Fits a second-degree polynomial to the detected lane pixels.

Calculates lane curvature in meters using real-world scaling factors.

Vehicle Position Calculation

Determines the vehicle’s offset from the lane center.

Helps evaluate whether the vehicle is drifting or centered in the lane.

Visualization

Overlays detected lane lines on the original image.

Displays lane curvature and vehicle offset on the image for easy interpretation.

Supports video output for continuous lane tracking in real-time scenarios.

Applications

Autonomous Driving: The pipeline provides foundational perception for self-driving vehicles.

Driver Assistance Systems: Can be integrated into ADAS to warn drivers when drifting from lanes.

Educational Tool: Helps students and researchers learn computer vision, image processing, and real-world applications of polynomial fitting.

Robotics: Useful for mobile robots or drones navigating along lanes or predefined paths.
